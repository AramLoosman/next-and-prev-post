## Component to display the Next and Previous Post based on current Post from  [RainLab Blog](https://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-blog)

Just include the component in your post page

	{% component 'nextAndPrev' %}

You can set a category filter, this way the Next/Prev post will be from the category selected.

If left blank, the component will display the next / previous post from the database
